# shadcn/ui Component Rules

## Usage Rule
When asked to use shadcn components, use the MCP server.

## Planning Rule
When asked to plan using anything related to shadcn:

- Use the MCP server during planning
- Apply components wherever components are applicable
- Use whole blocks where possible (e.g., login page, calendar)

## Implementation Rule
When implementing:

- First call the demo tool to see how it is used
- Then implement it so that it is implemented correctly

## MCP Server Integration
- Always use `mcp_shadcn-ui_get_component` to fetch component source code
- Use `mcp_shadcn-ui_get_component_demo` to see usage examples
- Use `mcp_shadcn-ui_list_components` to explore available components
- Use `mcp_shadcn-ui_get_block` for complete UI blocks
- Use `mcp_shadcn-ui_list_blocks` to see available blocks

## Best Practices
- Understand the component through demo before implementing
- Follow exact implementation patterns from demos
- Prefer complete blocks over individual components when building pages
- Integrate with existing design system (monochrome theme, pill vs rectangular buttons)
